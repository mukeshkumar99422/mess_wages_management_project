Perfect 🚀 This is a great project idea, and we can break it into **modules** for clarity.

Here’s a **detailed plan** for your Hostel Mess Diet Management Web App:

---

## 👨‍🎓 Student Features

1. **View Today’s Menu**

   * Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks, Dinner (updated daily by accountant).
   * Stored in DB with `date` as key.

2. **View Extra Items + Prices**

   * Example: Paneer Curry ₹30, Ice Cream ₹20.
   * Extra items vary daily → linked with date.

3. **Manage Extra Items Taken (Daily Basis)**

   * When a student eats an extra item, he selects:

     * Item name (dropdown from that day’s extra items list).
     * Quantity (default = 1).
     * Date (auto = today, but can be changed).
   * Stored in DB with **student_id + date + item + price**.

4. **View Past Records**

   * Student enters/selects a date.
   * System shows:

     * Regular mess menu of that date.
     * Extra items available that day.
     * What that student took and price.

5. **Monthly Analysis of Extra Diets**

   * Total extra expense for the month.
   * Item-wise breakdown (optional, like a small report).
   * Graphs/Charts (using Chart.js or Recharts).

## 👨‍💼 Accountant Features

## 📊 Database Schema (Simplified)

### `users`

| id | name | email | password | role (student/accountant) |

### `menu`

| id | date | breakfast | lunch | snacks | dinner |

### `extra_items`

| id | date | meal_type (breakfast/lunch/dinner) | item_name | price |

### `student_extra`

| id | student_id | date | item_id (FK to extra_items) | qty | total_price |

---

## 🔥 Flow

1. Accountant logs in → updates menu + extra items.
2. Student logs in → sees today’s menu + extra items.
3. Student selects extra items → stored in DB.
4. Student can query old records by date.
5. Monthly report → SQL aggregation (`SUM(total_price) GROUP BY month`).

👉 Question for you:
Do you want me to **make a step-by-step implementation plan with sample code (React + Node.js + MySQL)**, or just the **system design and workflow**?
